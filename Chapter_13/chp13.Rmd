## Example 13.5: The Aircraft Primer Paint Problem

Use the ANOVA described above to analyze the aircraft primer paint experiment described in Section 13.4.1.

```{r}
#the book has poorly formatted data, we need to take data from this framework
```
```{r echo = F}
include_graphics("C:/Users/Tyler/Documents/Spring18/Quality_Control/Screenshots/Example_13_5.png")

```

```{r}
#to this one
Adhesion_data <- read.csv("Adhesion_Force.csv")
Adhesion_data
```


```{r}
#this formatting is easiest to do in excel, and is often a requirement when approaching a problem using R

#R read the primer data as numeric, we need categorical data
Adhesion_data$Primer <- as.factor(Adhesion_data$Primer)

#perform anova
anova(lm(Value ~ Primer + Application + Primer*Application, data = Adhesion_data))

```


## Example 13.6: Router Vibration

```{r}
#again, the data is formatted poorly in the book
Router_data <- read.csv("Router_Vibration.csv")

#format the data for our categorical variables
Router_data$A <- as.factor(Router_data$A)
Router_data$B <- as.factor(Router_data$B)

#apply anova
anova(lm(Vibration ~ A + B + A*B, data = Router_data))

#we can get the effects using equations 13.11, 13.12, and 13.13
#option 1
effect_A = (1/(2*4))*(96.1 + 161.1 - 59.7 - 64.4)
effect_B = (1/(2*4))*(59.7 + 161.1 - 96.1 - 64.4)
effect_AB = (1/(2*4)) * (161.1 + 64.4 - 96.1 - 59.7)
print(paste(effect_A, effect_B, effect_AB, sep = " "))

#When we fit a linear model, R automatically calculates the effects of each factor. We just need to divide by 2 and take the absolutely value of the value to find the answer here 

Vibration_fit = lm(Vibration ~ A + B + A*B, data = Router_data)
effect_A = abs(Vibration_fit$effects[2]) / 2 #the second number is the effect of the first factor, the third for the second, etc
effect_B = abs(Vibration_fit$effects[3]) / 2
effect_AB = abs(Vibration_fit$effects[4]) / 2
print(paste(effect_A, effect_B, effect_AB, sep = " ")) #print them all out

```

## Example 13.7: A 2^3 Factorial Design

An experiment was performed to investigate the surface finish of a metal part. The experiment is a 23 factorial design in the factors feed rate (A), depth of cut (B), and tool angle (C), with n = 2 replicates. Table 13.12 presents the observed surface-finish data for this experiment, and the design is shown graphically in Fig. 13.25. Analyze and interpret the data from this experiment. 

```{r}
#read in the data
#we can specify the column types using the colClasses parameter
Surface_data <- read.csv("Surface_Finish.csv", colClasses = c("factor", "factor", "factor", "numeric"))

#use anova
#we know we're going to be using the model to calculate effects later, so let's define it before anova this time
Surface_fit <- lm(Surface_Finish ~ A + B + C + A*B + A*C + B*C + A*B*C, data = Surface_data)
anova(Surface_fit)

effect_A <- abs(Surface_fit$effects[2]) / 2
effect_B <- abs(Surface_fit$effects[3]) / 2
effect_C <- abs(Surface_fit$effects[4]) / 2
effect_AB <- abs(Surface_fit$effects[5]) / 2
effect_AC <- abs(Surface_fit$effects[6]) / 2
effect_BC <- abs(Surface_fit$effects[7]) / 2
effect_ABC <- abs(Surface_fit$effects[8]) / 2

print(paste(effect_A, effect_B, effect_C, effect_AB, effect_AC, effect_BC, effect_ABC, sep = " "))

```
