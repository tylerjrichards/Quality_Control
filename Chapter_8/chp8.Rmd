## Example 8.1: Estimating Process Capability with a Histogram

Figure 8.2 presents a histogram of the bursting strength of 100 glass containers. The data are shown in Table 8.1. What is the capability of the process?
  
  
```{r}
Glass_containers <- read.csv("Glass_containers.csv")

#analysis
Glass_avg <- mean(Glass_containers$x)
Glass_std <- sd(Glass_containers$x)

print(paste("99.73 percent of all the glass containers will burst between ", Glass_avg - 3*Glass_std, " and ", Glass_avg + 3*Glass_std, "."))

#histogram
hist(Glass_containers[,c(1)])
```
  
  
  
## Example 8.2: One-Sided Process-Capability Ratios

Construct a one-sided process-capability ratio for the container bursting-strength data in Example 8.1. Suppose that the lower specification limit on bursting strength is 200 psi.  

  
  
  
```{r}
#read in data
Glass_containers <- read.csv("Glass_containers.csv")

#set variables
Glass_avg <- mean(Glass_containers$x)
Glass_std <- sd(Glass_containers$x)
LSL_bursting_strength <- 200


#Use equation 8.8 
Lower_capability_ratio <- (Glass_avg - LSL_bursting_strength) / (3 * Glass_std)

print(Lower_capability_ratio)
```


## Example 8.4: Confidence Interval in Cp

Suppose that a stable process has upper and lower specifications at USL = 62 and LSL = 38. A sample of size n = 20 from this process reveals that the process mean is centered approximately at the midpoint of the specification interval and that the
sample standard deviation s = 1.75. Find a 95% confidence
interval on C.  
  
  
  

```{r}
#enter data
USL <- 62
LSL <- 38
n = 20
s = 1.75

#Find point estimate
C = (USL - LSL) / (6 * s)

#Lower Bound from equation 8.20
Lower_b <- C * sqrt(qchisq(.025, n - 1)/(n - 1))

#Upper Bound from equation 8.20
Upper_b <- C * sqrt(qchisq(.975, n - 1)/(n - 1))

#confidence interval

print(paste("The CI is inbetween", round(Lower_b,3), "and", round(Upper_b,3)))




```


## Example 8.7: Measuring Gauge Capability

An instrument is to be used as part of a proposed SPC implementation. The quality-improvement team involved in designing the SPC system would like to get an assessment of gauge capability. Twenty units of the product are obtained, and the process operator who will actually take the measurements for the control chart uses the instrument to measure each unit of product twice. The data are shown in Table 8.6. 


```{r echo = F}
include_graphics("C:/Users/Tyler/Documents/Spring18/Quality_Control/Screenshots/Table_8_6.png")

```

```{r}
#read in data (only includes measurements 1 and 2)
Part_Measurement_data <- read.csv("Part_Measurement.csv")

#name the columns for ease of use
colnames(Part_Measurement_data) <- c("M1", "M2")

#create xbar and R columns
Part_Measurement_data$xbar <- rowMeans(Part_Measurement_data)
Part_Measurement_data$R <- abs(Part_Measurement_data$M1 - Part_Measurement_data$M2)

#ending it here, can't figure out what d is
#Find measurement error

```


## Example 8.7.2: The Analysis of Variance Method
  
  
Use Table 8.8 to show the analysis of variance for the experiment measuring thermal inpedance versus part number, operator/inspector.  


```{r}
#read in the data
Thermal_Impedance <- read.csv("Thermal_Impedance.csv")

#Part number should be a categorical variable, not a discrete numeric one
#The factor data type is a way to reshape the data to make the column categorical

Thermal_Impedance$Part_Num <- as.factor(Thermal_Impedance$Part_Num)

#create a linear model to perform anova on
#the example specifies the formula
#multiplication in a formula finds the interaction term
Thermal_fit <- lm(Value ~ Part_Num + Inspector + Part_Num * Inspector, data = Thermal_Impedance)

#perform and print the anova
anova(fit)
```
