#General Programming Concepts in R 

#This will cover if statements and conditionals, looping variables in R, and then loading and cleaning data with dplyr


#The first bit will be a collection of very useful functions in R
```{r}

z <- -3:2
which(z > 0) ##This finds the index values of the vector that satisfy the condition
z[which(z > 0)]


any(z < 1)
all(z >= -3)
all(z == 1)

```

##If/Else Statements

if statements execute a chunk of code if a condition is met with a TRUE value

```{r}

x=1
if(x > 0){
  print('Cool')
}

```

another example

```{r}
UT=20
UF=26
if(UT>UF){
  print('Woo Hoo')
}
```
in this case nothing gets printed. However, if we change the symbol direction we'll see it get printed

```{r}
UT=20
UF=26
if(UF<UT){
  print('We lost')
} else{
  print('We Won')
}
```

We can also use 'else if'
```{r}
grade=75
if(grade>=95){
  print('Excellent!')
}else if (grade>=85){
  print("Pretty good")
} else {
  print("RIP")
  
}
```



##Looping

Looping is an easy way to cylce through iterative procedures. The common expressions used in R loops are `for` and `while` loops. In addtition, there are two clauses `break` and `next`.   

###For Loops  
These loops are used when you want to iterate a known number of times.   

```{r}
for (i in 1:10){
  print (i)
}
```

```{r}
big.matrix <- matrix(rnorm(1000,100,15), nrow = 250, ncol = 4)
mean.matrix.row <- c()
for (i in 1:nrow(big.matrix)){
  mean.matrix.row[i] <- mean(big.matrix[i,])
}
mean.matrix.col <- c()
for (i in 1:ncol(big.matrix)){
  mean.matrix.col[i] <- mean(big.matrix[,i])
}
```

Lets make a set of data about student data. 

```{r}
ID <- 1:100
grade <- rnorm(100, 80, 5)
#hist(grade)
comment <- 1:100
for(i in 1:100){
  if(grade[i]>=85){
    #print('Excellent!')
    comment[i] <- 'excellent'
  }else if (grade[i]>=78){
    #print("Pretty good")
    comment[i] <- 'pretty good'
  } else {
    #print("You are stupid")
    comment[i] <- 'rip'
    
  }
}

report <- data.frame(ID, grade, comment)
```

#instead of printing each line

```{r}
grammys <- c("Chance", "Adele", "Flume", "Drake", "Chainsmokers")
char_num <- c()
for(name in grammys){
  char_num[name] <- nchar(name)
}

```
  
  
###Apply Functions
The apply() family pertains to the R base package and is populated with functions to manipulate slices of data from matrices, arrays, lists and dataframes in a repetitive way. These functions allow crossing the data in a number of ways and avoid explicit use of loop constructs. They act on an input list, matrix or array and apply a named function with one or several optional arguments.

The apply() functions form the basis of more complex combinations and helps to perform operations with very few lines of code. More specifically, the family is made up of the apply(), lapply() , sapply(), vapply(), mapply(), rapply(), and tapply() functions.

--This description of the apply() family comes from datacamp.com

####apply  
We use the ``apply()`` function to iterate over a matrix or array
```{r}
##create random matrix (big.matrix might still be around from before)
row.mean <- apply(big.matrix, 1, mean)
col.mean <- apply(big.matrix, 2, mean)
```

####lapply  
We use the ``lapply()`` function to iterate over a vector or list. Of note is that the output of this function is always in the form of the list.   

Look at the grammys
```{r}
numchar_gram <- lapply(grammys, nchar)

#If we want to get rid of the list:
unlist(numchar_gram)
```

####sapply
We use the ``sapply()`` function to do the same thing except it will try and put it into an array. 's' in sapply stands for simplify. If it can't get the result into an array it will produce the same results as ``lapply()``.  

```{r}
sn_gram <- sapply(grammys, nchar) ##USE.NAMES = FALSE will turn off names
```

####vapply
We use the ``vapply()`` function to do the same thing except now we must specify the output. 

```{r}
vn_gram <- vapply(grammys, nchar, numeric(1))
```  




###While Loops

while loops execute a chunk of code within their scope, while some logical conditions is satisfied.

These loops have the potential to run infinitely if the condition remains true indefinitely. 

```{r}
i=0
while(i<5){#very similar to for loop
  i=i+1
  print(i)
}
```

#Now we'll go through dplyr
#when you get new data, about 0% of the time it will be in the right format and immediately useful for modeling or analysis
#first spend a bit of time talking about what a library is and why it is useful, then talk about dplyr and go through a few useful functions and then be done

```{r}
#install.packagess(c("datasets", "dplyr"))
library(datasets)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
head(airquality)

```

```{r}
filter(airquality, Wind > 5)
```

```{r}
filter(airquality, Temp > 80 & Month > 5)
```


#now switch to learning mutate (keep in mind we'll be learning piping and group by at the end)
```{r}
mutate(airquality, TempInC = (Temp - 32) * 5 / 9)
```

And now summarize, we use na.rm=T to make sure the mean doesn't come out weird

```{r}
summarise(airquality, mean(Temp, na.rm = TRUE))
```

Now introduce piping before we do group by. Piping is super useful because it allows us to do multiple things to data without saving each thing. So if we have to filter and mutate our data, we can just

```{r}
airquality %>% 
  filter(Month != 5) %>% 
  mutate(TempInc = (Temp - 32) * 5 / 9)
```

Now explain group by and that's done
```{r}
airquality %>% 
    filter(Month != 5) %>% 
    group_by(Month) %>% 
    summarise(mean(Temp, na.rm = TRUE))
```
