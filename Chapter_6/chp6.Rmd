## Example 6.1: X and R Charts for a Manufacturing Process
  
A hard-bake process (see Section 5.3.1) is used in conjunction with photolithography in semiconductor manufacturing. We wish to establish statistical control of the flow width of the resist in this process using and R charts. Twenty-five samples, each of size five wafers, have been taken when we think the process is in control. The interval of time between samples or subgroups is one hour. The flow width measurement data (in x microns) from these samples are shown in Table 6.1.

## Example 6.4: X and s Charts for the Piston Ring Data, Variable Sample Size
  
  
Consider the data in Table 6.4, which is a modification of the piston-ring data used in Example 6.3. Note that the sample sizes vary from n = 3 to n = 5. Use the procedure described on page 255 to set up the and x s control charts.

## Example 6.5: Loan Processing Costs

The mortgage loan processing unit of a bank monitors the costs of processing loan applications. The quantity tracked is the average weekly processing costs, obtained by dividing total weekly costs by the number of loans processed during the week. The processing costs for the most recent 20 weeks are shown in Table 6.6. Set up individual and moving range control charts for these data.  


```{r}
Loan_app = data.frame(Weeks = c(1:20), Cost = c(310,288,297,298,307,303,294,297,308,306,294,299, 297,299,314,295,293,306,301,304), MR = c(NA, 22, 9, 1, 9, 4, 9, 3, 11, 2, 12, 5, 2, 2, 15, 19, 2, 13, 5, 3))

Ind_value = Loan_app[,2]
x_chart_one = qcc(Ind_value, type = "xbar.one")

```

```{r}
#!is.na removes all the missing data, which are refered to as NA, which means Not Available
#in plain english, this says filter the data in Loan_app's third column for the values that are not missing
moving_average_values = Loan_app[!is.na(Loan_app[,3]),3]

#each group in this chart is the change between 1 group and the next, so group 1 is the moving average between the first and second observation. 
moving_average_chart = qcc(moving_average_values, type = "xbar.one")
```
