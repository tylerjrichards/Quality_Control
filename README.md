# Quality_Control
This repo is for the Quality Control Fall and Spring 2018 classes and contains all the necessary content for the R portion of the class covering the textbook "Introduction to Statistical Quality Control".  
The goal of this repo is to bring open source software to Quality Control. Reproducibility, a community of users, and collaboration between domains are all crucial to both engineering and learning in general, and I hope to help turn Quality Control into a computationally intensive class that prepares students for the world of big data and variability.  
I personally created the large majority of these examples using the textbook mentioned above as a guide, and if you have any additions or revisions please either create a pull request or message the author directly.
